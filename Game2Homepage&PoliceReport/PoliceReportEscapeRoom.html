    <p class="report">Dear Agents,<br><br>
        Welcome to your new job working on the top-secret Saylor Twift case as cyber investigators. As you may know, our
        client, Saylor Twift, has recently been hacked, resulting in the exposure of unreleased music.

        Luckily, the anonymous suspect left behind their briefcase and lockbox at a recent Saylor Twift concert, which
        you have access to on your desk. Your team has been hired to investigate this hacker and stop them before they
        release more music. You can do this by using the information in the briefcase and lockbox to discover their
        password and break into their computer.<br><br>

        However, we have a few rules we'd like to go over.
        <ol class="rules-list">
            <li>
                Preserve the evidence. Be respectful of the artifacts and don't break anything. We want this project to be
                available for future agents.
            </li>
            <li>
                No cheating, including no phones. We can't risk this information being compromised. You may consult your
                instructor if you need any hints!
            </li>
            <li>
                Teams are permitted to use their own scrap paper for note-taking and problem-solving throughout the
                investigation process.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        Work together to find the attacker's identity. Once you have the name,
        enter it below and click 'SUBMIT' to notify the authorities. This should take the team about 30 minutes to complete.
        Good luck, agents! Your expertise and teamwork will be instrumental in cracking this case and safeguarding
        Saylor Twift's music. Let's bring this attacker to justice!<br><br>
