# 🎤 The Eras Breach
### Cybersecurity Escape Room Experience

**University of Pittsburgh – INFSCI 1740 Capstone Project**

---

## 📖 Overview

**The Eras Breach** is an interactive, web-based cybersecurity escape room inspired by real-world cyber incidents and a narrative themed around leaked unreleased music.

Players take on the role of digital investigators tasked with uncovering the identity of a hacker responsible for a major data breach. Through exploration, problem-solving, and digital forensics techniques, players must navigate multiple puzzles to identify the attacker and report them.

# READ THIS BEFORE EDITING ANYTHING


## **Before** writing code
    # Make sure you're on main
    git checkout main

    # Download the latest version of main from GitHub
    git pull origin main

    # Create a new branch for your task
    git checkout -b feature/your-task-name

    # To check out an already created branch from GitHub use
    git checkout -b feature/task-name origin/feature/task-name

---

## **While** coding
- Save and test your work locally.
- Commit often with meaningful messages.

    # Check status
    ```git status```
    * Find filepaths you changed (e.g. lib/pages/home.dart)

    # Stage changes
    ```git add path/to/file/changed```
    * Do this for every file you have changed
    
    # Check status before committing
    ```git status```
    * Ensure you are only committing files that reflect your changes
    * If you didn't modify it, don't add it, this mainly applies to autogenerated files (build dir, macos, linux, etc.)

    # Commit your work
    ```git commit -m "Describe your change here"```

---

## **After** coding your feature
    # Make sure your branch is up to date with main
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout feature/your-task-name
    git merge main

    # Push your branch to GitHub
    git push origin feature/your-task-name

---

## **Submitting your work**
1. Go to GitHub.  
2. Open a **Pull Request** (PR) with:
   - **Base branch**: main  
   - **Compare branch**: feature/your-task-name  
3. Request a review from teammates.  
4. Once approved, the PR will be merged into main.  



## To Start
Run either command in cmd
    node server.js
    npm run dev
